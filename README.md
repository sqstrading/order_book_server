## Functionality

This server provides the `l2book` and `trades` endpoints from [Hyperliquid’s official API](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/websocket/subscriptions), with roughly the same API.

- The `l2book` subscription now includes an optional field:
  `n_levels`, which can be up to `100` and defaults to `20`.
- This server also introduces a new endpoint: `l4book`.

The `l4book` subscription first sends a snapshot of the entire book and then forwards order diffs by block. The subscription format is:

```json
{
  "method": "subscribe",
  "subscription": {
    "type": "l4Book",
    "coin": "<coin_symbol>"
  }
}
```

## Setup

1. Run a non-validating node (from [`hyperliquid-dex/node`](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/node)). Requires batching by block. Requires recording fills, order statuses, and raw book diffs.

2. Then run this local server:

```bash
cargo run --release --bin websocket_server -- --address 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

If this local server does not detect the node writing down any new events, it will automatically exit after some amount of time (currently set to 5 seconds).
In addition, the local server periodically fetches order book snapshots from the node, and compares to its own internal state. If a difference is detected, it will exit.

If you want logging, prepend the command with `RUST_LOG=info`.

The WebSocket server comes with compression built-in. The compression ratio can be tuned using the `--websocket-compression-level` flag.

## Caveats

- This server does **not** show untriggered trigger orders.
- It currently **does not** support spot order books.
- The current implementation batches node outputs by block, making the order book a few milliseconds slower than a streaming implementation.
